PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Make a program that asks the user for a number between 1 and 100. 
The program then needs to generate a number also within that range.
The program will compare the two numbers to see which is highest.
The winner will get a 'point'. First to 3 points wins.

NOUNS: usrNbr, comNbr, usrWins, comWins, gameOver

VERBS: prompt, alert, while, output


INPUTS:
    usrNbr, comNbr

PROCESSING: 
    prompt usrNbr
    randomize comNbr
    compare numbers
    assign winner
    display output 

OUTPUTS:   
    Round 1 results
    round 2 results
    round 3 results
    round ... results
    final winner


PSEUDOCODE:
HigherThanNumberGame {

    create usrNbr
    create comNbr
    create usrWins as number
    create comWins as number
    create gameover as bool

    create function pickingNumber
        while true 
            prompt for usrNbr with 'Pick number between 1-100 or 'quit'

            if usrNbr is 'exit'
                display notice of exit
                set gameover to true 

            if usrNbr is not between 1 and 100
                inform of invalidation
            else 
                break while
            end if
        end while
    finish function 

    create function DoingCalculations 
        while gameover is false
            run pickingNumber function
            if gameOver is true
                break while
            end if 

            change comNbr to Math.random() * 100 
            // Add round function?
            display 'You entered: [usrNbr] <br>The computer rolled [comNbr]<br><br>

            if usrNbr is greater than comNbr
                write 'you win the round'
                usrWins++
            else if usrNbr is less than comNbr
                write 'you lost the round'
                comWins++
            else 
                write 'tie'
            end if 

            if usrWins is 3
                write 'you win'
                change gameOver to true
                break while
            if comWins === 3 
                write 'you lose' 
                change gameOver to true 
                beak while
            end if 
        end while
    end function 

    if usrNbr is exit
        clear document //(how?)
    end if 

    call DoingCalculations function 
end function 

call HigherThanNumberGame function 


Given the nature of the program, 
I don't know if having specific test inputs will do much good.
I will however do inputs that might cause bugs in program flow

test case 1:

    inputs: 
        1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 100, -4, -20, 1000, 101, exit
    
    expected result:

        You entered ...
        The computer rolled
        You lost/win/tie the round
    
        REPEAT X TIMES

        Game over! You won/lost three rounds!
    
    actual result:

        You entered: 1
        The computer rolled: 48
        You lost the round, sorry.

        You entered: 3
        The computer rolled: 94
        You lost the round, sorry.

        You entered: 5
        The computer rolled: 62
        You lost the round, sorry.

        Game over. Sorry, the computer won 3 rounds.

test case 2:

    inputs: 
        exit
    
    expected result:
        [alert] quitting program
        program exited

    actual result:
        [alert] Chickening out? Weak.
        Shame on you.
